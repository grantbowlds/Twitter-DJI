Final Project Proposal - MATH 2820 (L)


Title of project:
Impact of President Donald Trump’s Tweets on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during his Presidency

Names of group members:
Grant Bowlds, Immanual John Milton, James Tang

Problem statement: We will analyze the impact of a tweet from Trump on the New York Stock Exchange. We will track the changes in the market after each tweet and hopefully deduce whether on the whole Trump’s tweets boost, drop or do nothing to the economy. This information would be useful to any investor; they have a vested interest in predicting the market and if Trump’s tweets are a good predictor of a trend, it’s in their monetary interest to analyze this problem.

Data: We will use the data from Kaggle (Austin Reese) to get the entirety of President Trump’s tweets from January 2010 to May 2019. We will filter this data to only using the data from Trump’s Presidency. We will use more data from Kaggle (qks1lver) to get the values of the NYSE during the same time period.

Goals: Our first goal is to see if the quantity of tweets per day has an effect on the stock market. Our prediction is that the quantity of tweets will not have a significant impact on the percent change of the NYSE.
Our second goal is to see if certain words in tweets have an effect on the NYSE. Our prediction is that referencing the stock market directly will have a significant positive change, while tweets about foreign countries will have a significant negative change.
